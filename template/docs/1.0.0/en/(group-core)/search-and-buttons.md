# Search and buttons

Dock Rush indexes:

- Page titles
- Page content
- Version
- Language

You can also add **buttons** using files with the `.button.md` suffix. Buttons
can either open external links or jump to internal pages.

See the “Resources” button in the sidebar: it is implemented as
`docs/1.0.0/en/resources.button.md`.
