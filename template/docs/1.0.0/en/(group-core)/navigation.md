# Navigation: dropdowns and groups

Folders are rendered as either **dropdowns** or **groups**:

- Regular folders (for example `getting-started`) become dropdowns.
- Folders named like `(group-core)` become groups with a label and nested menus.

To configure a dropdown, add a `dropdown-settings.md` file into the folder and
set fields like `title`, `order`, `icon` and `dropdown: open | collapsible`.
