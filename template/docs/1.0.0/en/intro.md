# Dock Rush documentation plugin

Dock Rush is a React-based documentation shell that turns a folder of markdown
files into a full-featured docs site with:

- Versions (multiple doc trees by version)
- Languages (per-language folders with automatic switching)
- Groups and dropdowns (for navigation structure)
- Buttons (links and page shortcuts)
- Full-text search over titles, content, versions and languages

This page gives you a high-level overview. Use the sidebar to explore
installation, configuration and advanced features.
