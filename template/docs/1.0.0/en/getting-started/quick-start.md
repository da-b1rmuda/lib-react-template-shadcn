# Quick start

After installation, create your first docs page:

```md
docs/1.0.0/en/intro.md
```

The sidebar will automatically show a version called `1.0.0` and a language
switcher if you also add a `ru` version of the same page.

To see live reload in action, edit any markdown file under `docs/` while the dev
server is running — Dock Rush will update the tree without a full reload.
